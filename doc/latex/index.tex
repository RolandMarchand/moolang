Moolang is an educational programming language designed and written by \href{https://moowool.info/}{\texttt{ Moowool L. Summerwheat}} to teach developers C programming and compiler design.

Moolang aims for code quality first and foremost, and makes use of excellent basic and advanced practices to optimize the educational value of the codebase.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Compiling}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Moolang uses CMake and is written for Linux with glibc. TODO\+: find the minimum compatible build.
